# 📘 React Course – Learning and Projects Repository

This repository documents my complete journey of learning **React.js**, including hands-on projects and key concepts like **Hooks**, **Props**, **React Router**, **Redux**, and **Redux Toolkit**.  
It serves as both a **learning log** and a **portfolio of mini-projects**, showcasing my progress from fundamental React concepts to building scalable applications.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

### ⚛️ React Fundamentals
- Creating functional components  
- Passing and managing **props**  
- Conditional rendering and list rendering  

### 🪝 React Hooks
- `useState` – manage component state  
- `useEffect` – handle side effects  
- `useRef` – access DOM elements and store mutable values  

### 🔄 State Management
